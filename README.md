# 1. Business Problem
The newly hired CEO seeks comprehensive and detailed information to support his strategic decisions aiming to boost the company's performance in a competitive scenario. In this regard, the data team was requested to develop a control panel with the company's key business indicators

# 2. Assumptions made for the analysis
1. The data used for analysis and dashboard construction are available on the Kaggle platform: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akashram/zomato-restaurants-autoupdated-dataset?resource=download&select=zomato.csv

2. For better organization of the dashboard, the business metrics were divided into: General Information, Country Information, City Information, and Cuisine Information.
# 3. Solution Strategy
Some key questions were asked for each of the respective business information to be analyzed. These business questions were answered and delivered to the CEO through graphs and tables on the dashboard.

- General Information:
  - Number of Registered Restaurants.
  - Number of Registered Countries.
  - Number of Listed Cities.
  - Number of Reviews.
  - Types of Cuisines Liste.
  
- Country Information:

# 4. Key insights
Among all registered countries, India stands out with the highest number of registered restaurants and the most extensive geographical presence, followed by the United States and England. Although India also hosts a large number of dishes considered expensive, the analysis of the average cost for two people reveals that Indonesia takes the lead, followed by Australia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and India.

Among the 10 cities with the highest number of restaurants, four are Indian, one is English, one belongs to the United Arab Emirates, another to Qatar, one to South Africa, and one to Brazil. In the analysis of cities with the highest number of restaurants with an average rating above 4, Bras√≠lia (Brazil) ranks first, followed by Hamilton, New Zealand.

In terms of culinary diversity, Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, takes the lead, followed by Adelaide, Australia.

In the overall analysis, it is evident that, although Zomato is established in various countries, there is a clear predominance of the company's services usage in India and the USA. This points to new investment opportunities in other nations, which can significantly contribute to profit growth and business diversification.
